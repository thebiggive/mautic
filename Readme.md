# The Big Give's Mautic

This repository is a thin layer for tooling used by the Big Give to
test and deploy Mautic.

The Docker tag `mautic/mautic:v4-apache`, managed by the Mautic community,
is the basis for the app code. Everything we do should extend and
minimally alter the app we pull from the upstream, official Docker images.
